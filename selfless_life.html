                        There was a moment last week when I realized something very important. Let me
                        start with a brief intro to this short story. I spend the whole week in summer camp where I was helping with games
                        and all sort of activities for kids. It's not that important what I did through the whole week,
                        what is important is that I spend the week without any access to a computer. It was amazing, just to
                        be alive and not to think about work all the time.
                        Long story short, it was the perfect break for me after half of the year of everyday coding, everyday study. So
                        let me tell you what really happened.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        On Friday evening, I was already late for the last lecture of the camp. I was
                        leaving the dining room
                        and noticed that there was someone preparing some stuff for that evening. I kindly asked her
                        if she needs some help. Right after that, I said something very stupid.
                        I said that I'm already late so I can help and at least I don't have to do push-ups.
                        I offered help only
                        because I want to get an excuse so I do not have to do push-ups. One rule in our camp was that
                        if you are late you need to do one push-up
                        for every second you are late. My help offer was refused and I walk away. I can't imagine someone could
                        accept my help after my intentions were clarified. I do not realize what I said but while I was walking away I
                        realized what I just said. I sit to other kids hoping that person does not realize what I just said. I have no idea
                        why I said that because I do not care if I had to do push-ups or not. I really want just help. I have no idea
                        how something so stupid could slip out just like that.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        Later that night I realized something more profound about what I said. One of the main goals of mine is
                        to be unselfish,
                        to let go of myself for good of others. I realized that I'm trying to be unselfish and I'm doing
                        it for selfish reasons.
                        It is really weird that I help somebody only to look better in eyes of other people.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        For the last couple of days, I tried to figure out how to help others selflessly.
                        In Mark 12:31 is written
                        'Love your neighbor as yourself.'. That means I cannot lose interest in myself completely, can I?
                        How can I love others when I do not love myself? So how do I juggle both, love myself and love others, and keep them in harmony?
                        As one of my favorite writers, C. S. Lewis once said, “Humility is not thinking less of
                        yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.”
                        That pretty much clarify everything for me.
                        So do not underestimate yourself, simply do not speak about yourself all the time.
                        Just help. Get rid of any side thoughts, do it honestly. If you can't do that, just keep your mouth shut.
                        It's much harder to take it back, so it's better to don't say it in the first place.
