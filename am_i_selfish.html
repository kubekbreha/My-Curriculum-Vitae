                        There was a moment last week when I realized something very important. Let me
                        start with a short story. I spend the whole week in summer camp where I was
                        helping with games
                        and all sort of activities for kids. It was great mainly because I spend the week without any
                        access to a computer
                        and I could spend time with people I care about. It was amazing, just to
                        be alive and not to think about work all the time.
                        Long story short, it was the perfect break for me after half of the year of everyday coding,
                        everyday study. So let me tell you what really happened.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        On Friday evening, I was already late for the last lecture of the camp. I was
                        leaving the dining room
                        and noticed that there was someone preparing some stuff for that evening. I kindly asked
                        if she needs some help. Right after that, I said something very stupid.
                        I said that I'm already late so least I don't have to do push-ups.
                        I offered help only
                        because I want to have an excuse so I do not have to do push-ups. One rule in our camp was that
                        if you are late you need to do one push-up
                        for every second you are late. My help offer was refused and I walk away. I can't imagine
                        someone could
                        accept my help after my intentions were clarified like that. I do not realize what I said but
                        while I was
                        walking away it strike me. I sit to other kids hoping that person does not realize what I just
                        said. I have no idea
                        why I said that because I do not care if I had to do push-ups or not. I really want just help. I
                        have no idea how something so stupid could slip out just like that.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        Later that night I realized something more profound about what I said. One of the main goals of
                        mine for this year is to be unselfish, to let go of myself for good of others.

                        I thought I was being selfless that whole time because I was worried about other people. Then I
                        realized that I was actually worrying about what other people think about me. That's about as
                        selfish as one can get because all of my thought is concerned with me.

                        Why do we help others?
                        We help because it is the right thing to do, isn't it? I'm not quite sure about that.
                        It is really weird that I help somebody only to look better in his/her eyes or just to get
                        something out of it.
                        Maybe I just want to feel good about myself.
                        I think that's all really bad motives.
                        I wish there could be some way to change that.
                        I wish I could help out of the genuine hard.
                        But why do I want to change that?
                        Because I will be better that way. I will feel better about myself when I help selflessly, help
                        others truly from the hard.
                        I realized that the reason why I want to have a different motive is that I have the same motive.

                        So what does that mean? If I can't do the right thing by doing and if I can't do the right
                        thing by not doing. I want to be unselfish because I'm selfish.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                        For the last couple of days, I tried to figure this out.
                        In Mark 12,31 is written
                        'Love your neighbor as yourself.'. That means I cannot lose interest in myself completely, can
                        I?
                        How can I love others when I do not love myself? How do I juggle both, love myself and love
                        others, and keep both in harmony?
                        As one of my favorite writers, C. S. Lewis once said, “Humility is not thinking less of
                        yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.”
                        That pretty much clarify everything for me.

                        So do not underestimate yourself, simply do not speak about yourself all the time, especially
                        when you offering help.

                        There was the man who put worth and value on you and there is nothing that can add some value to
                        you
                        and there is nothing
                        what can take worth and value from you.
                        In Ephesians 2,8-9 is written "For by grace are ye
                        saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
                        Not of works, lest any man should boast. "

                        You can't get better than somebody by helping, there is no competition in helping business.
                        You can't win. You can only lose because it does not really help when you want to get something
                        from it.

                        Just help. Try to get rid of any side thoughts, do it honestly.
                        Do it because of it right thing to do.
                        If you can't do that, please
                        just keep your
                        mouth shut.
                        It's much harder to take back what you said, so it's better if you don't say it in the first
                        place.

                    </p>

                        So let's get back to the title of this blog. Am I selfish? Hard to say, but I can assure you I
                        will do my best in trying not to be. </p>
