                            Did you ever have that feeling that you got a great question to ask, but you liked that question so much that you want to give the answer more than hear one? That is exact feeling I have right now.
                            For the last couple of months, I was trying to improve my dialogues with people. That means I wanted to be more present in moments when I talk with somebody and don't let anything distract me from that conversations. It
                            worked really good but, I find out that If I want to go deeper and get to really know the person I better have some good questions ready in my pocket. Don't take me wrong, talking about the gym, coding and some other
                            stuff
                            is great but only until the certain point.
                            The one question that stands above all other questions I prepared goes like this: "What is the most astonishing thing in life. What amazes you every time you see it, experience it, hear it or maybe feel it. Whatever it
                            is. Just tell me what it is. "
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            I meet one little girl while ago. Maybe meet isn't the best word for it. Let's stick with that I saw a girl. I believe she didn't even notice me and I didn't try to approach her. What I found very interesting about
                            her was that she talked to herself quite a lot. It looks like she lives in a different world than me. She talked to her friend I wasn't able to see. She sings to him. She was telling stories to him. I just sit alongside
                            and thought what the heck is wrong with her. She looks very odd to me at that time. I thought that she has some kind of physical disorder. I just couldn't get why she behaves that way.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            It was a bit odd for me back then, but I can't say the same thing now. The answer to the question I have asked myself is that the thing that amazes me the most is what was going on in mind of that girl. Obviously, I do
                            not think about that girl all the time, it can be applied to anybody. You sit in a bus, wait somewhere in a line, drive a car or maybe talk with somebody in the middle of the night. It always interests me what thoughts
                            are going through the head of those people I'm with. The crazy thing about it is that it is very hard to guess that. If I want to approach everybody perfectly objectively and rational, I wouldn't know that all these
                            people I met have thoughts. If I went and opened heads of these people and looks inside there would be no thoughts to see. I will see there just neuron firing and
                            electrical impulses but I wouldn't see their thoughts, I wouldn't see if they picture rose. I wouldn't be able to see that rose. The only reason I believe they can picture everything in their mind is that I can picture
                            things in my mind. But I
                            don't have other proof outside of that.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            Hey this guy looks like me, talk like me he is probably having the same internal experience, but I have no scientific evidence of it, whatsoever. That can't be rational believe anymore. That is the conjunction, I'm just
                            guessing what his thoughts are. That's where art and subjectiveness come in. If it wasn't for my subjective reality I wouldn't believe that he have any.

                            If I only could know, how much clearer would some situations become, how much better will I deal with different situations, how much more I could please the people around me. Think about all that different views on the
                            world you could enjoy. You could have the possibility to see the world through eyes of others, see all the beauty they picture, see fears they face. That would be great, wouldn't it? For me, it definitely would. What is
                            sad, is that we will never have that ability. So what we have been left off with? I think questions are the only weapon we have. Still not very effective one. As sharp the question could be and as deep they can cut, our
                            thoughts still cloud stay protected by the answers we give. We can stay unexposed. We can answer something for people to hear, but still, keep our deepest thoughts protected.

                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            As much as we can do is ask. Ask how others see the world, what feelings raise in them. Maybe we will get some honest answers. So try it. Try to ask. Also, try to answer honestly, do not be afraid to put your
                            thoughts on the trail. Everyone does not deserve to know whats on your mind, but some people do.
                            What I want form you to keep doing is that do never stop imagining. Use your creativity, because subjectivity is the reality of the world. Our minds are very powerful tools, in there every color could be bright, every day
                            could be sunny, every girl could be beautiful. So do not cut your subjectivity out, do not ignore it. Embrace it. </p>
