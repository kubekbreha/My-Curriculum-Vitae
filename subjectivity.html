                            Did you ever have that feeling that you got a great question to ask somebody, but you liked that question so much that you want to give answer more that hear one. That is exact feeling I have right now.
                            For last couple of months I was trying to improve my dialogues with people. That mean I wanted to be more present in that moments, don't let anything distract me. It worked really good but
                            I find out that If I want to go deeper and get to know person on another level I better have some good questions ready in my pocket. Don't take me wrong, talking about gym, coding and some other shuff is great but only until certain point.
                            The one question that stand above all other questions I was thinking about
                            goes like this: "What is the most astonishing thing in life. What amaze you every time you see it, experience it, hear it or maybe feel it. Whatever it is. Just tell me what it is. "
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            I meet one little girl while ago. Myabe meet isn't the best word for it. Let's stick with that I saw a girl. I believe
                            she didn't even notice me and I didn't even try to aproach her. What I found wery interesting about her was that she
                            talked to herself. It looks like she lives in different world than me. She talked with her friend I wasn't able to see.
                            She sing. She was telling him stories. I just sit alongside and thought what the hack is wrong with her. She looks very odd for me that time.
                            I thought that she has some kind of physical disorder. I just couldn't get why she behave that way.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            It was bit odd for me back then, but I can't say the same thing now. The thing that amazes me the most is what was going on in mind of that girl.
                            Obviously I do not think about that girl all the time, it can be applied to anybody. You sit in bus, wait somewhere in line, drive a car or maybe talk with somebody in the middle of the night.
                            It always intersts me what thoughts is going trough head of that people. The crazy thing about it is that if I want to aproach eberybody perfectly objectively and rational, I wouldn't know that
                            all these people I met in all kind of different situations have thoughts. If I went and opened these people heads and looks inside there would be no thoughts to see. I will see there just neuron firing and
                            electrical impulses but I wouldn't see people thoughts, I wouldn't see how them picture things around them. Only reason I believe they can picture everything in their mind is because I can picture things in my mind.
                            But I don't have other proof outside of that.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 133%; margin-top: 5%;">
                            Hey this guy looks like, talk like me he is probably having the same internal experience, but I have no scientific evidence of it, whatsoever. That can't be rational believe anymore.
                            That is cunjunctor, I'm just guesing what his thoughts are. Thats where art and subjectivness comes in. If it wasn't for my subjective reality I wouldn't believe that he have any.
